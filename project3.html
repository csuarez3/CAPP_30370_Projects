<h2>insistent PLS novice, dubious CAPP learner, and proud Notre Dame student</h2>

<h3>Sentences most used by my mother:</h3>
<ol>

	<li>Do not slide down the banister wearing white shorts.</li>
	<li>If you need a nap, just take one and stop complaining.</li>
	<li>Put down the book and talk to people!</li>
	<li>You are so annoying!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Common retorts by me:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I didn't do it!</li>
	<li>Wait, what?</li>
	<li>You never said that...</li>
	<li>Can I go to my room now?</li>
	<li>Great.</li>
</ul>

<h2>I do not own a crystal ball.</h2>
	<p><b>It seems as if most people on campus do, however.</b>  And for these people, I have a simple question: <i>how?</i>  How do you know what you want to do with your life?  According to <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/04/life-expectancy-map/"> National Geographic</a>, the average life expectancy for women is 81 years on average and for men it is 76.  Consider that most undergraduates walking around campus are between the ages of 18 and 21.  This means that my fellow students have lived only for about a fourth of their lives, yet they have managed to plan the rest of it.  <i>How jealous am I of this ability?</i>  Incredibly.  My crystal ball broke right after I realized that I would never be President of the United States due to a very simple reason: I hate politics.  So now I have to painstakingly replan my entire life when I know I will change drastically over the next <strong>sixty</strong> years.</p>
	<p>The astronaut idea did not go very far; the pirate plan tanked; I cannot ride a horse, so I could never be a cowgirl; and I can barely open a jar of jelly, so there went my future as a body builder.  What's left?  What can I do?  I am literate, I suppose.  There is a certain charm in being able to correct people and get paid for it; I do so enough anyway, might as well make it into a job.  Even though that last sentence may not be the best evidence of my very tentative career plan, I am on the path to becoming an editor.  A very shaky and tentative path, but a path nonetheless.</p>

<h2>Why editing?</h2>
<h3>It couldn't have to do with beauty, could it?  See <i>The Witch of Portobello</i>.</h3>
<blockquote>Elegance isn't a superficial thing, it's the way mankind has found to honor life and work.  That's why, when you feel uncomfortable in that position, you musn't think that it's false or artifical: it's real and true precisely because it's difficult.  That position means that both the paper and the brush feel proud of the effort you're making.</blockquote>
<p>The beauty in those couple of lines encompass everything for which I strive.</p>
